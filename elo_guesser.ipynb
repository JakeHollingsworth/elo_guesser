    "In this notebook, we begin training a transformer to predict the ELO rating of 2 participants in a chess game given the move order. ELO ratings attempt to quantify and rank the ability of chess players; they are determined by the lichess ELO rating system (Glicko 2 rating system: https://lichess.org/page/rating-systems). \n",
    "\n",
    "We use games selected from a single month of the lichess open database (https://database.lichess.org/). Only rapid time control games are included. Data is stored in .pgn format, a standard file format for recording chess games. Each .pgn file contains information for multiple games. For each game in the .pgn file, we extract the ELO of the white and black player, the move order, given in algebraic notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)) and the result of the game (\"1-0\" for white win, \"1/2-1/2\" for a draw, and \"0-1\" for black win) which is concatenated at the end of the move history. These are then written to a .csv file for easier processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We train a RoBERTa model from the Hugging Face library (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) on the bidirectional (dynamic) masked machine learning task in order to get an informative fixed size representation of the move history. To our knowledge, no existing transformer model exists which has been trained on a large corpus of chess games in algebraic notation, and so transfer learning is not available and training begins with a random initialization of weights. After completing training on the masked language model task, we fine-tune the model to solve the particular problem of predicting player elo ratings from move history. We organize our models in this way to mimic the organization of standard NLP applications, where a large pretraining step is done on the masked machine learning task, which is then fine-tuned for a particular use case."

As such the transformer takes fairly long to train, especially since we don't currently have access to a local gpu. Training is done in a google colab notebook seperately and the trained model will be available here. 12 hour runtime limits are bypassed by frequent checkpointing / restarting the colab kernel. Memory limits are bypassed by splitting the source text into multiple smaller text files and looping over these text files. These details of implementation complicate the code, though, and so are only shown in the colab notebook."

    "Our model achieves an MAE of 194 ELO on out of sample data. It is worth emphasizing that we do not expect a perfect predictor to exist -- player performance has varies largely game-to-game, however player ELO is unresponsive to these fluctuations. Additionally, move order of course does not contain all information needed to predict player ELO. With these difficulties in mind, though, there is likely still room for improvement as our model is quite small (6 attention heads, 3 hidden layers) due to current limitations in computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the model has issues predicting meaningful differences between the ELO of the white and black player. This is likely due to underfitting: the model is likely not complex enough to pick up on the positional dependencies which reveal which moves were made by which player. Training a larger model may prevent this. That being said, the average ELO predictions tend to be in the correct vacinity."
